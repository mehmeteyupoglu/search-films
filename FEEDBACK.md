- Atomic design approach is more suitable as a design language or when building UI frameworks. It makes more sense to use it when communicating with designers,
rather than following the same architecture in the code. When building mid/large scale of applications, it becomes very difficult to find out what component is where. Just a tip.
- I have converted a page component from options API to composition API to see the difference. Only benefit is not an opiniated approach, but better readability, typing support and easier refactoring.
- Other than above, it looks pretty fine actually, good work
